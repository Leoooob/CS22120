Minutes of meetings will be stored in the `man/minutes` directory. There must be one file per meeting, and the file name must have the following form:

```
yyyy-mm-dd_minutes
```

(plus any file extension) where:
- *yyyy* is the year
- *mm* is a two digit number representing the month, using leading zeros where required (January = 01)
- *dd* is a two digit number representing the day of the month using leading zeros where required.

e.g., the minutes of the regular weekly meeting of the project group held on 6th January 2012 might be saved in a file called `2012-01-06_minutes.txt`. The advantage of using this naming convention is that when the file names are listed, they can be made to appear in order of the date.
