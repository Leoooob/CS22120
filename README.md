Git Repository for the CS22120 Group Project.

Directory structure
-------------------
- **docs** This contains documents produced by the group members. Each document should be in its own directory.
- **lib** This contains any third party libraries used by the project.
- **man** Management documents are stored in this directory. Specifically, there should be a `minutes` directory and a `plan` directory. The plan directory will contain the project plan document.
- **src** This contains the source code for the project, arranged into the relevant directories corresponding to their position in the package hierarchy or in other language defined arrangements. If a project requires more than one program in the system, one directory, appropriately named, may be required for each.
- **test** Test code is stored in this directory. Unit tests will be stored in a structure which reflects `src`, and `test` may be a subdirectory of `src`. Other test harnesses will be stored in directories related to specific test at the top level of `test`.

Minutes of meetings will be stored in the `man/minutes` directory. There must be one file per meeting, and the file name must have the following form `yyyy-mm-dd_minutes`.
